 ## Preview:
 The above link will direct you to a Tower of Hanoi game with counters to track the time and number of moves required to complete the game after selecting the desired number of disks.

 ## Technology Used:
- Animate.css:  Added animation to the disks and winning message
- Command Line:  Navigated files and interacted with GitHub
- Google Chrome:  Developer Tools used to debug and review code and tested the application via the browser
- OneNote:  Built wireframe
- Visual Studio Code:  HTML, CSS & Javascript coding

## Approach:
The main approach for this game was to track the number of moves and time used as the user successfully moved the disks from the left hand tower to the right hand tower. An array was used with a for loop to create the disks.  Conditional statements were used to display the time, select/move the disks and determine when the user won the game.

## Main features:
- Number of disk dropdown list
- Move and time counters
- Restart button
- Animation added

## User Stories: 

## Unsolved Problems

## Future Plans
- Apply draggable feature to the disks.
- Develop process to store the user's time, moves and number of wins.
- Add a automated solve feature to reflect the ideal number of moves.
